title: Go for evening walkðŸš¶
---
When people talk about productivity, there is always more emphasis on the number of hours put in a day. However you can only work x hours ( depends from person to person ) in a day after which you start to get depreciating results.

It's the act of switching off after a hard day's work that never gets the same attention as the other productive hacks. You don't feel productive when you are recharging your batteries. Things like having a regular sleep schedule and going for walk might not feel useful in the short term but they do matter in avoiding burnout.

Personally, as a remote worker, it's very easy to not leave my house at all. Hence I kind of force myself to go for a walk in the evening because

- Helps clear my head after a long day
- Gives me a chance to listen to some awesome podcasts
- Be in the midst of nature

[Everyone from Beethoven, Goethe, Dickens, Darwin to Steve Jobs took long walks](https://www.canva.com/learn/taking-long-walks/) and you should too set aside a time for going for long walks. Trust me, you won't regret it.
