title: Taking an afternoon nap üò¥
---
In today's day and age, any employed person does not get a chance to take an afternoon nap. Only companies like Google, Apple might have sleeping pods. But for the majority of working class, it's like a mirage.

I am one of the lucky people who get to work remotely. Hence I get a chance to recharge my batteries in the afternoon after working for 3-4 hours in the morning. I think this is one of the major perks of working remotely. And not just for you. The side effect of resting for 20-40 mins is that you are ready to have another productive session of 3 hours before you decide to call it a day.

The afternoon time is generally considered the time of day when people are not that energetic. Rather than chugging along with their dropping heads, wouldn't it be great if you are able to refresh by taking a nap. Tea and coffee are stimulants that work as well, but naps are scientifically proven to be a more healthy way of invigorating oneself. Alas, our managers and leaders at our company either don't get it or choose to ignore this argument. I hope more people are able to work remotely, freelance or start business which allows them to enjoy the power of a siesta üôè
