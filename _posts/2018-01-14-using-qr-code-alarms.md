title: Using QR code to make sure you wake up ⏰
---
I always have a big problem in waking up. Especially in the winters, I tend to oversleep. And then there is a feeling of guilt of not sticking to my morning routine. 

If I have a productive morning, I generally tend to have a good day as well. Hence this hack is important for me.

I use [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep) app on my mobile phone which has an option to switch off alarms by scanning a QR code. It serves the required purpose because it forces me to get out of bed and go to the door where I have pasted the QR printout.

If you want to make it more challenging, you could paste the QR code in an outdoor space. I am sure after you see the morning light, the chances of getting back to bed, are minimal.

Hope that hack helps you to seize your day. Please feel free to comment. Thanks !

**PS:** If you tend to use the snooze option a lot, there is an setting to limit the amount of times you are allowed to snooze ⏰

**PPS:** Please don't cut down on your sleep hours. If you want to be productive, get a good night's rest.
