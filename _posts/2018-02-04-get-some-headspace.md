title: Get some headspace ☯️
---
Meditation was always this thing that I'd thought the mystics did. It didn't feel like a productive use of my time. But then mindfulness was a term which cropped up in a lot of text I was reading. At the same time, my brain was this cluttered mess which was unable to focus on a problem for more than 2 minutes. It always went looking for new stimuli ( which in today's world is very easily available ).

I decided to give it a go after watching this [awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Je0mu4GG-o). I started researching more about meditation and found this app called **headspace**. The guided meditations were a good way to make my way through uncharted territories. I finally found the value of having a calm mind.

## Benefits of Meditation
- Much calmer during the day ( less likely to get agitated when things don't go as expected )
- Able to do deep work for long periods ( as required in my profession )

## Ritual
- Meditate for 10-15 mins using [headspace](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getsomeheadspace.android&hl=en) app after waking up

## Getting started

The best part about headspace, is that it's actionable. You can read all the books about meditation and mindfulness but unless you make this habit part of your daily routine, it's very difficult to understand the value of it.

To get started, there is a free 10 day course on the headspace app. If you want to learn more there is a paid membership as well.

Happy Meditating !!
